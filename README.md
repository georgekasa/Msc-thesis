For the design of a passive filters, algorithms are necessary to increase your productivity in the designing of a filter and faster results, to design a simple passive filter of e.g. N =5 order, you must start from what approximation you want to design Butterworth, Cauer, Chebyshev, Pascal, Papoulis, etc. afterwards the cut off frequency, the gain of the passband and how many dbs you want the filter to drop in fs are necessary to start designing. After you have determine this specifications you must calculate the transfer function.
Finally when this procedure is over you must start to export the passive elements from the transfer function from  Feldkeller equations and Cauer to remove poles at infinity. If you want to design a low pass filter the procedure ends here with just denormalizing the passive elements, but if you want to design a band pass filter, or high pass, you must make a transformation of the Low Pass filter to your desire filter (band pass, high pass, etc). So to skip all this mathematical procedure I just made an algorithm which will help me to calculate faster the passive elements of the filters.
